                <p>And this is the beginning paragraph where we're going
                to explain the incredible things that can be done with
                branches.</p>
                
                <p>Blogs are the best way of sharing information and
                your ideas. Much better than going to conferences
                or coming out on youtube. Except if you're a rockstar.
